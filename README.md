# To-do-list
A to-do list is a list of things you need to do. It helps you remember your tasks and stay organized. You write down what you need to get done, and as you finish each task, you cross it off the list. This makes it easier to focus and not forget anything important.
# 📝 Simple To-Do List Web App

This is a basic **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The app runs entirely in the browser—no backend required.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed (with a strikethrough effect)
- Delete tasks from the list
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI

## 🧱 How It Works

### 1. HTML – Structure

The HTML file defines the structure of the page:
- A centered container holding the input field, "Add Task" button, and task list.
- An input field (`<input>`) where users type tasks.
- A button (`<button>`
